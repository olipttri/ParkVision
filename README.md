# ParkVision
Hello, welcome! üëã

This is an Artificial Intelligence project where we trained a model and applied it to a real-world use case. Our team explored its potential in the medical field, testing the capability of one model. This led to the creation of ParkVision (Parkinson Vision).

ParkVision is a web-based platform that allows users to upload hand-drawn spiral or wave patterns. The uploaded image is then analyzed by an AI model using machine learning (image processing) to detect potential Parkinson‚Äôs tremors or classify it as normal.
